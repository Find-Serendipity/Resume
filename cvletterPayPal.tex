	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am thrilled to apply for the \href{https://paypal.eightfold.ai/careers/job/274900124368}{UX Designer} position at PayPal. I am passionate about making beautiful products that are easy to use, so the opportunity to improve the current PayPal experience with my own experience and expertise is exciting.
	
	About ten years ago, while working with Internet Brands, I frequently used PayPal's merchant services. As I worked on improving our own user's experiences, I often found myself frustrated with PayPal's complex and difficult-to-navigate dashboards. It was then that I wished I could help improve the design to make things better for users like myself.

	Since then, I have gained extensive experience as a UX designer and full-stack developer. I've gone from working with a UX lead to design the best app experience for our community to designing my own user experiences for my own apps. I am proficient with design tools like Figma, Miro, and Excalidraw, and have a strong background in leading cross-functional teams.
	
	Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how I can help make PayPal's services even better, and to see how I can contribute my insights to your team.
