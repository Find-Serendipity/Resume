	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the
	\href{https://careers.homedepot.com/job/20584187/software-engineer-remote-remote/}{Software
		Engineer} position at Home Depot. With over two decades of
	community management experience at industry leaders like Zynga and Internet
	Brands, and collaborations with clients such as Forbes and Cointelegraph, I
	have a vast amount of experience assisting in developing and designing a
	product that my customers love.

	Graduating top of my class from Fullstack Academy has bolstered my
	expertise in modern web development, including JavaScript and SQL as well as
	with frameworks like React, Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma ORM. I'm honestly
	quite eager to code, and am delighted at the opportunity presented by your
	role.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my skills and experiences can contribute to Home Depot's engineering team!

	\closing{Best,\\
