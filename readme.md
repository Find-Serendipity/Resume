Hello Josh, I hope this message finds you well. I would love to apply for your Junior Software engineer & testing position at Arketa.

I've recently graduated at the top of my class from Fullstack Academy and since graduating, have been designing, building and testing my own projects. I'm also well versed in JavaScript, React, Node.js and SQL databases, and would love to learn more about NoSQL and scaling.

Before I became a full-stack engineer, my time was spent as a community manager, which I feel makes me an incredibly versatile and diverse programmer. I don't just think about the code, I am thinking about all the users on the other side of my code, and more specifically, about how I know they're going to break it. 20+ years of managing people and communities of all kinds will do that, I suppose.

I'd love to have the opportunity to show you what it means to have a community-driven developer on your team.

Best,
Hannah
