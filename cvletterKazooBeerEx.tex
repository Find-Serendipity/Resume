	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Social Media Content Creator role with the
	Kalamazoo Beer Exchange. As a local resident and occasional patron, I'd love to
	be able to use my skills to help support your amazing ideas!

	I have a wealth of experience creating compelling stories across
	written and visual media thanks to 20+ years of managing communities and social
	media channels. You may have even seen some of my more recent volunteer work!
	I've been lending my social media talents to the local Kalamazoo Game Night
	events at places like Main Street Pub and Wax Wings. I've helped grow the
	visitors to those events from a little more than a dozen, to routinely maxxing
	out the capacity of the venues we've been allowed to play at.

	I love Kalamazoo and the independent brewery scene that's here, and
	feel my talents will really help you tap into the local social scene that's
	here.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my experience can contribute to The Kalamazoo Beer Exchange's team.
