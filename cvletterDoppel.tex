	I am excited to apply for the \href{https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Doppel/0cc6eced-3f1d-475f-aadd-13d5235ea026}{Software Engineer} position at Doppel, as I am passionate about keeping communities safe, and have been committed to spreading anti-phishing awareness through my work for quite some time. With a robust background in full-stack development and a proven track record at industry-leading organizations, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.

	Graduating top of my class from Fullstack Academy has equipped me with extensive knowledge in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, complimented by team project experience. My previous community management roles have refined my collaborative and problem-solving skills. I have successfully led cross-functional teams, increased community engagement, and driven strategic initiatives. I have a proven track record in building scalable applications, fostering teamwork, and implementing user-friendly solutions.
