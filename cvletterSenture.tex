	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Call Center Rep role with Senture. With 10+ years of experience working inbound and outbound customer service channels such as phone calls, web chat, and emails for a variety of clients.

	As a customer service representative for Mod Squad, I learned concierge-level techniques for handling even the most upset customers, and trained to provide live in-game customer service over voice chat. Writing reports at the end of every shift was mandatory, and I am accostomed to gathering and reporting all the data I can when handling inquries.

	While working at Internet Brands with Model Mayhem, I provided top-tier customer service, frequently problem-solving independently to ensure the best results for my clients. My experience at Breaktime Studios further honed my ability to multi-task and to adapt and innovate in fast-paced environments.

	Thank you for considering my application. I would love to discuss how my experience would benefit the Senture team. 

	\closing{Best,\\
