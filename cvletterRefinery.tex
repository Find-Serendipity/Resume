	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Graphic Designer role for The Refinery. I would love to bring my 20+ years of social media, content, and community management expertise to such a diverse role.

	I have a wealth of experience creating compelling stories across
	written and visual media thanks to 20+ years of managing communities on social
	media channels like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. I have blogging
	photography and editing experience, as well as more complex image editing with
	programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. I also utilize AI programs
	like Midjourney and ChatGPT to help create compelling content for social media
	posts.

	Most recently, my graphic design skills were put to the test while publishing my lastest game, Alley Cat, a retro-feeling side scrolling game {(which you can play here: \href{https://cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com/}{cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com} -- please allow a moment for the game to load!)} The graphic design and other design decisions for the final look and feel of the site and game were mine, including choosing the correct typography to help give the right feeling to the game. I can provide other graphic design or photography samples upon request. 

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my many talents and abilities can contribute to the marketing team at The Refinery.

	\closing{Best,\\
