	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Creative Director role for Bud and Mary's Cannabis. With over 20 years of managing communities and producing engaging creative content for various blogs, guides and whitepapers under my belt, I am an expert in developing brand strategies that resonate with the intended community.

	My experience touches on many aspects you're looking for. At Model Mayhem, I had two direct reports and about 50 volunteer reports. At Community.co, I implemented continuous integration practices in our community processes, utilizing advanced data analysis techniques that I had to train my remote staff on. At Breaktime Studios I helped manage the creative teams, and at Zynga I was part of a vastly innovative environment. When I was just 13, I taught myself how to use Photoshop and other Adobe Suite apps and have consistently utilized some kind of photo editing software since, especially as wireframes for UX/UI designs became more important to my work.

	Most importantly I am familiar with cannabis marketing strategies, both towards invidivuals as well as towards dispensaries, and what I don't know, I can easily learn.

	You can see some of my work and technical writing ability following a branded style below:

	how my experience can contribute to the marketing team at Bud and Mary's Cannabis.
