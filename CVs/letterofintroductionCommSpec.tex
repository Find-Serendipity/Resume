\begin{letter}{Kalamazoo RESA \\ Executive Director of Human Resources \\ 1819 E. Milham Ave \\ Portage, MI 49002}
	\opening{Dear KRESA Hiring Team,}

	I am writing to express my strong interest in the Communication Specialist position. Based on the job description, this role requires a blend of technical communication skill and a genuine understanding of educational communities—a combination that directly reflects my professional experience and personal passions. My fifteen-year background in content development and community engagement would allow me to make a significant contribution to KRESA’s work.

	The qualifications listed are an excellent match for my skill set. For instance, at both Internet Brands and with my own clients at Communitrix, I regularly used MailChimp to create and manage email campaigns. My experience with WordPress is even more in-depth, including managing HTML/PHP codebase for my Communitrix clients. This is complemented by my proficiency with the Adobe Creative Suite, which I have used to produce a wide array of content from company branding to marketing materials.

	Beyond the technical tools, I am deeply experienced in the day-to-day requirements of content creation. I\'ve been responsible for producing a wide array of communications, from printed newspapers in college and magazines with the Industry of Sound Artist Collective, to crafting marketing materials for the Washington Manufacturer’s Council. I\'ve created technical content for Model Mayhem, handbooks for employees with Internet Brands, and press releases for Breaktime Studios. At the Air Zoo, I\'ve been utilizing my talents with data analysis and report creation to generate membership reports for potential donors.
    
    In creating this variety of materials, I have proven that I can not only develop a creative concept but also execute it professionally, ensuring it aligns with organizational standards. This is where my passion for artistic excellence and visual storytelling becomes a key asset: while not my primary professional focus, I have dedicated thousands of hours in my life to photography and film. Taking pictures allows me to share my view with the rest of the world, and serves as another way for me to communicate my thoughts and feelings.

	At the heart of my professional approach is a foundation of inclusion and collaboration, a practice I\'ve honed in diverse and demanding environments. At Community.co, our fully remote structure required a high degree of independent drive, yet every success was the result of intense, team-oriented effort. This collaborative spirit extends across cultural and geographical divides; at Internet Brands, I built such a strong rapport with our engineering team in Mexico that the project manager and I are still friends today.

	Blending independent problem-solving with a deep respect for teamwork is a core part of my professional philosophy, guided by my core professional values: integrity, a commitment to keeping stakeholders informed, and the adaptability to embrace new challenges. I believe in continuous improvement, and I am confident this approach, combined with my skills, makes me an excellent match for the responsibilities of this role and the values of KRESA.

	Thank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss what I can bring to your team.
