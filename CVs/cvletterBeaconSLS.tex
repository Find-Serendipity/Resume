	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Content Creator role with Beacon
	Specialized Living Services. Beacon's group has been a familiar sight for me
	when I am out at Bronson park, and would love to be able to use my skills to
	help support Beacon's residents and the overall mission to support the Beacon
	community.

	I have a wealth of experience creating compelling stories across
	written and visual media thanks to 20+ years of managing communities on social
	media channels like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. I have blogging
	photography and editing experience, as well as more complex image editing with
	programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Figma. I also utilize AI programs
	like Midjourney and ChatGPT to help create compelling content for social media
	posts.

	You can see some of my public-facing social media work at the following
	Facebook pages. For samples of my technical writing ability following the
	branded style, please see the blog from my time at Model Mayhem.

	how my experience can contribute to Beacon's team.
