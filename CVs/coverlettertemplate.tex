\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31252280}{post}
I saw your \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31252280}{post} in this
month's HackerNews ``who is hiring?'' thread, and it caught my attention.
I would be excited to learn more about your Senior Full Stack Software Engineer
position to see if we would be a good fit for each other!

As a proponent of free and open-source software, I was encouraged to see that
you are building tools to help teams intelligently and deliberately include it
in their products. I was also excited to see Go and Haskell listed in your tech
stack, since I have a fondness for them as a hobbyist.

I welcome any of your questions, and I look forward to learning more about your
team and business.

\closing{Best,\\
