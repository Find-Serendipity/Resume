	\opening{Dear Hiring Managers,}

	The staff at the Kalamazoo Urban Gardens informed me yesterday that the location might be hiring now or soon, and encouraged me to apply for a role. If you aren't currently hiring, I will hope you'll keep my resume on file for when you do!
	
	I currently work part-time at the AirZoo museum here in Kalamazoo, where I work as a ride operator and front desk staff member. The duties are varied, and range from operating heavy machinery around small children to handling cash and ticket sales. I handle inventory regularly by assisting with facing in the front of the gift shop and organizing backstock in the basement. Every day I am there, I engage with people from all walks of life to help them to not only navigate around the museum, but to purchase items from the gift shop and cafe.

	I am available immediately and have a lot of flexibility to take morning through evening shifts, any day of the week.

	Thank you for your time today, I hope to hear from you soon. 

	\closing{Best,\\
