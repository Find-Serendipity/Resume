	\opening{Dear Chawntay,}

	I am quite eager to apply for the
	\href{https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/apex-hosting-llc-full-stack-software-developer}{Full-Stack Software Developer} position at Apex Hosting, LLC. As a veteran of gaming industry leader Zynga and several other start-up gaming studios, and a lover of Minecraft, I'm excited to apply to such an important game service company.

	I recently graduated top of my class from Fullstack Academy with proficency in langauges and tech like JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Node.js, Express.js and React. I am continuing to expand my programming expertise by learning langauges like LaTex, PHP and Flutter/Dart, and by experimenting with tech like Laravel, Docker and MySQL.
	
	To give you an idea of my work as an engineer, I invite you to play my latest game, Alley Cat, which you can find here: \href{https://cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com/}{cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com}. Allow the game to load for a moment, and then enjoy! I hope it will demonstrate my ability to work with a team to produce a vanilla JavaScript game in a short amount of time. My contributions can be found in our repository on my GitHub, which I configured to allow for continuous integration as part of my rigorous testing regimen.

	I believe my insight into gaming communities combined with my skills as a fullstack engineer makes me uniquely suited to become a part of your team. Thank you for considering my application for the Full-Stack Software Engineer position. I look forward to speaking with you further over how my experience can benefit Apex Hosting, LLC.
