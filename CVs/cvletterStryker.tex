	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the \href{https://careers.stryker.com/remote-senior-staff-software-engineer/job/1739AA650CF49317B819F20E05B8A0D3}{Senior Staff Software Engineer} position at Stryker, especially after my last visit to the Kalamazoo Valley Museum. I count myself proud to be one of the many people who love to build things to call Kalamazoo home.
	
	With over a decade of experience in full-stack development, community management, and project leadership, I'd like to believe I am a good fit for the R\&D Integrations team. My recent re-education at FullStack Academy has equipped me with expertise in modern web development technologies and best practices. 

	While my primary experience is in JavaScript and related frameworks, I am eager to expand my expertise to include C\#, .NET, and cloud platforms such as Azure and AWS. I have a proven ability to learn and adapt to new technologies quickly. My experience includes leading teams, mentoring juniors, and conducting code reviews to ensure high-quality code and effective project delivery.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experiences align with Strykerâ€™s goals and how I can contribute to the R\&D Integrations team.

	\closing{Best,\\
