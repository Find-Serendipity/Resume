	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am excited to apply for the \href{https://boards.greenhouse.io/fay/jobs/4022817008}{Software Engineer} position at Fay. I've often been told that I am solutions-oriented, with an Idea Tree that never ceases to bear fruit. I enjoy identifying issues and resolving them efficiently both in work and out in the world. My love for community-driven development is central to my work and I adore integration and unit testing to ensure code quality and reliability.

	At Fullstack Academy, I gained expertise in JavaScript, React, and Node.js, building impactful projects and enhancing my teamwork skills. I led my teams' high engineering standards by example, focusing on communication, collaboration and continuous integration.

	While working at Internet Brands with Model Mayhem, I implemented scalable web application solutions, frequently problem-solving independently to ensure seamless functionality. My experience at Breaktime Studios, an early-stage startup in San Francisco, further honed my ability to adapt and innovate in fast-paced environments.

	I am eager to bring my problem-solving abilities and dedication to quality to Fay. Thank you for considering my application.

	\closing{Best,\\
