	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the
	\href{https://boards.greenhouse.io/scaleai/jobs/4368630005}{Developer
		Relations
		Manager} position at Scale AI. With over two decades of
	community management experience at industry leaders like Zynga and Internet
	Brands, and collaborations with clients such as Forbes and Rolling Stone, I
	specialize in engaging diverse audiences and crafting impactful content of all
	kinds for my communities.

	Graduating top of my class from Fullstack Academy has bolstered my
	expertise in modern web development and AI technologies, including JavaScript,
	React, HTML, CSS, and Node.js — essential for creating effective technical
	content. Even before attending the boot camp, I excelled in simplifying complex
	technical concepts into accessible content, boosting user engagement and
	product adoption.

	Scale AI’s commitment to advancing AI technology fits well with my
	professional values, and I am impressed by the company's dedication to
	innovation and its mission to accelerate AI development across industries. I am
	excited to leverage my community management experience and technical training
	to produce content on AI/ML technologies, while supporting a larger goal of
	enhancing AI education.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my skills and experiences can contribute to Scale AI’s Brand and Product
	Marketing team and its mission to shape the future of AI technology.

	\closing{Best,\\
