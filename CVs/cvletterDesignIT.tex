	\opening{To the hiring managers at DesignIT,}

	Thank you for reviewing my application for the
	\href{https://boards.greenhouse.io/designitnorthamerica/jobs/7694873002}{Social
		Community Manager} role. I was directed to this position by
	Abbey Kurimski on LinkedIn; she reached out after reviewing my profile and
	background.

	With over 20 years in community management, Iâ€™ve honed a wide range of
	skills, including managing high-volume customer support, leading social media
	channels for brands, and addressing technical issues.

	In the time before my resume begins, I worked with Metaverse Modsquad,
	where I did many tasks being asked of your Social Community Manager. I
	worked with stakeholders, monitored and engaged with users on social media for
	the brands I repped, found and supported super users to help drive community
	engagement, and moderated live virtual events with users.

	I've tracked and reported on technical problems across enough websites
	and apps that I recently became a Fullstack engineer to be able to better
	explain when something goes wrong. I've written copy for social media, emails,
	newsletters, blogs, technical instructions and I even worked with the legal
	team at Internet Brands to update their Terms of Use. The same legal team helped me create the Terms and Conditions for
	contests and sweepstakes for our users. I also promoted user-generated contests
	while working at Breaktime Studios Games and Metaverse, but this was before I
	learned more about constructing valid, legal contests. I really love being able
	to facilitate joy for users in this way.

	Most importantly, I know how to manage social media channels and the
	people who come to those channels. In the last 20 years, the places people have
	gathered to talk to each other have changed, and how we access those places has
	drastically evolved, but users will continue to be users. If users are there, I
	want to be there too.

	If you are looking for a talented, experienced community manager who
	will work their hardest for you and your community, search no further. I'd love
	to bring my talents to DesignIT and make my experience of use to you. I look
	forward to discussing the role further with you.

	\closing{All my best,\\
