	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer position at The StudioC. This role presents a wonderful opportunity to help church communities grow, and I am particularly drawn to your mission of bringing clarity and purpose to church member engagement. With over a decade of experience in community management and full-stack development, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. 

My education at FullStack Academy has equipped me with expertise in modern web development technologies, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Prisma. I have successfully led projects, managed databases, set up testing environments, and ensured seamless API integration.

Having grown up with both of my grandparents as ministers, I learned importance of honesty, integrity, and doing the right thing, even when no one is watching quite early. These values guide my personal and professional life to this day.

I am eager to bring my skills in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and technical support to The StudioC. My background in Agile methodologies and proactive problem-solving will help enhance the customer support experience. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my abilities and experiences align with your goals and how I can contribute to your team.

	\closing{Best,\\
