	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Mobile App Community Lead position at CDLLife. With over two decades of
	community management experience, I have a vast amount of experience driving community development and growth in a safe environment.

	When I worked for Internet Brands, I was actually the community manager for the \href{https://www.classadrivers.com/ }{classadrivers.com} community and forums for a number of years. I was a major driver of getting our forums onto Tapatalk so that our community could communicate with each other on mobile.

	Being the community manager for that forum for so long taught me a lot about the transportation industry, but most importantly, taught me a lot about the trucking community that I carry around with me to this day. I've used this knowledge and insight to educate my friends and family and correct misconceptions about trucking when I hear them.
	
	Truckers are a wonderful group who do so many amazing things, and I would love the opportunity to once again be able to help manage such a wonderful, vibrant community as your Mobile App Community Lead.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with the needs of CDLLife's community.

	\closing{Best,\\
