	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the
	\href{https://boards.greenhouse.io/eclipse/jobs/4036865008}{Developer
		Relations
		Associate} position at Eclipse. With over two decades of
	community management experience at industry leaders like Zynga and Internet
	Brands, and collaborations with clients such as Forbes and Cointelegraph, I
	specialize in engaging incredibly diverse audiences and crafting impactful
	content of all kinds for my communities.

	Graduating top of my class from Fullstack Academy has bolstered my
	expertise in modern web development, including JavaScript and SQL as well as
	with frameworks like React, Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma ORM. I'm honestly
	quite eager to code, and was delighted to read that you may ask whoever you
	hire to help dev teams code with some of the simpler, open-source projects.
	That sounds like the perfect way to really get into the developer community and
	build a relationship with them.

	What's even more exciting is the chance to travel to connect with
	developers where they're coding --- nothing really beats a face-to-face
	connection! This is why I have always enjoyed setting up events for my
	communities --- it's delightful to sit back and watch people making
	connections.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my skills and experiences can contribute to Eclipse's marketing team and
	its mission to shape the ecosystem of the next generation!

	\closing{Best,\\
