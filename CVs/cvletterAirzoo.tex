	\opening{To Jenna and the other hiring managers,}

	Thank you for considering my application for the Retail Assistant Manager position for the Fly Buy.
	
	Though I do not have any immediate experience directly in retail, my career started in retail at places like Bath and Bodyworks, Joanns, and Tacoma Pipe and Tobacco. I spent from 2005 until 2009 managing backstock, displaying inventory, and keeping records for reordering. I helped achieve sales goals year after year until I went back to college.

	From there, I gained experience working jobs that saw me in social media, community management, and assisting in achieving online sales goals. I learned how to create KPIs based on internal performance and how to best gather and analyze data in order to make better decisions. At Internet Brands I managed my own customer service team for the first time, where I quickly mastered how to manage my staff and the myriad of tasks that also still must be completed exclusively by me.

	I've only continued to add to my pool of knowledge as time has passed, recently adding in skills involving fullstack development and website management, including helping a client with their Shopify site. I've also been assisting with photography and content creation for the Airzoo's GEM manuals.

	I hope like me you will feel that there is a bit of providence at work, as the role you're hiring for requires the exact talents and skills I happen to have. I look forward to speaking with you about what I can do for the Fly Buy as the Retail Assistant Manager. 

	\closing{All my best,\\
