	\opening{Dear Securitas Hiring Team,}

    I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Administrative Officer position. When I read your core values—Integrity, Vigilance, and Helpfulness—I felt an immediate connection, as these are principles I strive to live by every day. I believe my dedication to these values, combined with my professional skills, makes me a great fit for your team.

    The job description places a strong emphasis on Excel, a skill I have honed extensively. In my previous roles, I was responsible for transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights. This involved creating detailed charts, graphs, and tables for stakeholder reports, analyzing membership and community trends, and ensuring the absolute accuracy of sensitive information. I am very comfortable compiling data and using visual aids to make complex information easy to understand.

    My commitment to vigilance and integrity is a cornerstone of my work. At the Air Zoo, ensuring a safe environment around powerful equipment has trained me to be proactively watchful and detail-oriented. This same principle applies to how I handle data—with precision and care. At my core, I am a helpful person, which is why I maintain CPR and First Aid certifications. I believe in being prepared to assist whenever needed, a value that seems central to the mission at Securitas.

    Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my skills and my dedication to safety and teamwork to Securitas.

	\closing{All my best,\\
