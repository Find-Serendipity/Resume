	\opening{Dear Sean,}

	I am quite eager to apply for the
	\href{https://cinemaplus.com/employment}{Sales and Support Engineer} position
	with CinemaPlus, as I want nothing more than to fix my local cinema's website.
	That is actually how I found this role in the first place - I was looking to
	see if there was someone I could reach out to to get the issues with the
	checkout fixed! As it turns out, that is exactly the role you're hiring for.

	While I lack the working experience with PHP and XML, graduating top of my
	class from Fullstack Academy bolstered my expertise in full-stack web
	development, including with langauges like JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS and
	with tech like JSON, Jest, Bootstrap and Tailwind. What I don't know about PHP
	I am certain I can master in no time, especially if given guidance, as I'm only
	familiar with PHP v7 and v8.

	I would like to bring not only my programming skills to the table, but
	also my talents with working directly with customers and clients. As a
	community manager, I was often the front of troubleshooting problems and
	solutions via calls, emails and sometimes live chats. This service often
	resulted in data gathering, analysis, and reports for my project manager.

	Mostly, I would like to work with you as an employee so that as a
	customer I can utilize the service seamlessly and without frustration. I know
	the pain many customers have likely been through and feel given the chance I
	would be able to make a big difference for my fellow movie-going fans!

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward
	to discussing how my experience can contribute to the CinemaPlus
	engineering team!
