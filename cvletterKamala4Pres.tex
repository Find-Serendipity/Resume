	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the Supporter Communications Strategist role for Vice President Kamala Harris for President. I have over 20 years of managing communities and producing engaging creative content for various blogs, guides and whitepapers under my belt, and consider myself an expert in writing copy that resonates with the intended community.

	My experience touches on many aspects you're looking for. At Model Mayhem, I had two direct reports and about 50 volunteer reports, and often wrote the copy they disseminated to the over 1 million members of the site. At Community.co, I was charged with writing copy to satisfy our CEO-level clients and to appeal to non-clients as well. At Breaktime Studios I created and distributed content across all social media platforms. At Zynga I helped manage the online gaming communities.

	I know how important it is to uplift messages on social media, and how crucial it is to get the right message for the correct audience at the perfect time. I am fired up about this election now more than I have ever been, and believe I have the technical writing chops required to engage with all kinds of political and apolitical supporters. 

	Thank you for considering my application. I would love to discuss how my talents writing copy for diverse communities could be used to help get Kalama Harris elected as our first woman president!
