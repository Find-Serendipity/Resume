	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am quite eager to apply for the
	\href{https://www.shopify.com/careers/software-engineering_0b039ccc-373c-4011-a7fb-744264427ce4?}{Software Engineering} position
	with Shopify. I was recommended to apply by a friend who suggested that Shopify was looking for someone like me - an insatiably curious, creative generalist eager to learn. I don't think you'll find a more eager or willing engineer!

	I recently graduated top of my class from Fullstack Academy with langauges and tech like JavaScript, TypScript, SQL and React at my fingers. My last major project, Alley Cat, a retro-feeling side scrolling game {(which you can play here: \href{https://cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com/}{cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com} -- please load for a moment)} will demonstrate my ability to work with a team to produce a polished product in a short amount of time. We completed our project in only three weeks.

	What I lack in professional programming experience, I make up for with immense experience in other vital areas, such as working with senior stakeholders to resolve complicated technical problems, tackling vague ideas or designs to produce specific content, and collaborating with and providing support to cross-functional teams across time zones and various countries. I am also an entrepreneur, having exclusively founded Communitrix, a community management company, in 2023.
 
	I think the real reason I was recommended to apply, however, lies in my desire to create things. My friends know me as a woodcrafter and watercolor artist, occasional embroidery enthusiast and bead-bracelet junkie. I craft for the love of making beautiful things, and for the relaxing nature of some of the work. I would love to see what it takes to make codecraft!

	Thank you for considering my application. I would love to lend my experience to the Shopify engineering team.
