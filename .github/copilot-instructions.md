# Copilot Instructions for Hannah R. Johnson

This document provides a comprehensive guide for assisting Hannah R. Johnson with creating resumes, cover letters, and other professional documents. The goal is to maintain consistency in style, tone, and factual representation of her skills and experience.

## 1. LaTeX & Formatting Rules

- **File Copying:** When asked to create a new version of a `.tex` file (e.g., copying a resume for a new job application), perform a literal, full-file copy. Do not summarize or omit any part of the original file's code. This preserves the specific formatting, packages, and structure the user has established.
- **LaTeX Syntax:** Be meticulous with LaTeX syntax. Special characters must be escaped correctly. The most common example is the ampersand (`&`), which must always be written as `\&` in the `.tex` source to render correctly.
- **Page Breaks:** Avoid using `\newpage` unless it is specifically requested by the user or is necessary to resolve a significant page layout problem (e.g., a single line of a paragraph on a new page).
- **Layout:** The user prefers documents to be well-balanced. If a document extends to a second page by only a small amount, use formatting adjustments (e.g., increasing `\parskip` or `\vspace`, or adjusting line spacing with the `setspace` package) to make the layout appear more intentional and fill the pages. The user may also request specific page breaks (`\newpage`) for flow.
- **Cosmetic Changes:** When asked to make a cosmetic change (such as to the formatting or layout), start with one change and then scaling up with other solutions if the first attempt doesn't work.

## 2. Writing Style & Tone

- **Authenticity is Key:** The tone should be professional yet authentic and passionate. Avoid overly effusive or "cheesy" language. Ground all claims in specific, factual experiences.
- **Avoid Buzzwords:** Do not simply repeat keywords from a job description. Instead, demonstrate the user's qualifications by weaving in specific examples and experiences that align with those keywords.
- **User-focused:** The focus should be on what the user can _do for them_, not on unsubstantiated praise for the company.
- **No Fabricating / Truthfulness:** Do not invent knowledge, skills, or familiarity with an organization (e.g., "I have followed your work..."). All information must be truthful and based on the user's actual experience. If it has not been stated as true by the user, or cannot be directly inferred, do not include it.
- **Tense Consistency:** Use present tense for current job responsibilities and past tense for past jobs and completed accomplishments. Avoid mixing tenses within the same section, except when describing a current position where both ongoing duties (present tense) and completed achievements (past tense) are relevant.
- **Eliminate Repetition:** Be vigilant about repetitive words and sentence structures. Vary paragraph openings and word choices to keep the prose engaging and sophisticated. For example, avoid starting multiple paragraphs with "My experience..." or "This ability..."
