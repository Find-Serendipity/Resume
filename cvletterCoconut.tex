	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am eager to apply for the React Web Developer position at Coconut
	Tree Software. I'm eager to utilize my vast community as well as my engineering experience to write code,
	and am delighted at the opportunity presented.

	Graduating top of my class from Fullstack Academy has bolstered my
	expertise in modern web development, including JavaScript and SQL as
	well as with frameworks like React, Node.js, Express.js, and Prisma ORM. I
	taught myself how to use Jest in order to best implement unit testing and
	implemented continuous integration with GitHub for my projects in order to
	ensure good code across my team. I've taught myself several other
	languages, like LaTeX, Flutter/Dart, and PHP, and have learned how to use some
	amazing frameworks like React Native and Laravel.

	As a result of my many years as a community manager, I've been blessed
	with skills in content creation, copy writing, and implementing SEO. I've
	worked cross-functionally in almost all the roles I've ever had, working across
	development, marketing, legal and financial teams to build some great products
	for our users.

	Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing
	how my skills and experiences can contribute to Coconut Tree Software's
	development team!
