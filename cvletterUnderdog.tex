	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am excited to apply for the open \href{https://boards.greenhouse.io/underdogfantasy/jobs/4049546005}{Engineering} position at Underdog. I'm drawn to the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic team that shares my passion for building innovative games.

	At Fullstack Academy, I gained expertise in React.js, which I used to display my final project - a JavaScript side-scroller game for the web using canvas. I led my teams' high engineering standards by example, focusing on communication, collaboration and continuous integration.

	While working at Internet Brands with Model Mayhem, I implemented scalable web application solutions, frequently problem-solving independently to ensure seamless functionality. My experience at Breatime Studios and Zynga Games honed my ability to adapt and innovate in fast-paced environments.

	I am excited about the possibility of bringing my technical expertise and collaborative spirit to Underdog. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with your teamâ€™s needs.

	\closing{Best,\\
