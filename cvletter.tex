I saw your job post on Greenhouse and it caught my eye. I'm very interested in your job for a Software Engineer - Frontend, Generative AI! I really like how Scale AI is making AI better by using good training data and smart solutions. It's cool that you're doing so much with generative AI, which is something I'm really excited about.

At Community.co, I created engaging technical content using tools like ChatGPT, improving engagement by 30\% and streamlining content creation by 20\%. At Internet Brands, I led cross-functional teams in project management and product development, translating complex technical concepts into user-friendly solutions. My skills include JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, and Node.js, all core requirements for this position.

Graduating from Fullstack Academy's web development bootcamp fortified my technical foundation and project management skills. My capstone projects, such as a full-stack e-commerce app and a retro side-scroller game, involved modern web technologies and AI tools, demonstrating my ability to build and manage data-intensive applications. For example, the e-commerce app utilized a Node.js backend and React frontend to handle high traffic, showcasing my ability to develop scalable solutions.

Although my degree is in Anthropology \& Archaeology, my dedication to learning and development in web technologies and AI has prepared me to excel in this role. I am confident that my community management, content creation, and technical expertise make me a strong fit for Scale AI. I welcome any questions and look forward to learning more about your team and business.
