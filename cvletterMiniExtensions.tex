	\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

	I am quite eager to apply for the
	\href{https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs/miniextensions-junior-software-engineer-full-time-contract-40-hr-wk-live-2}{Junior Software Developer} position
	with miniExtensions. As 10+ year veteran of product release cycles and client interactions, and with my unquenchable river of ideas, I believe I am ideal for your role.

	I recently graduated top of my class from Fullstack Academy with langauges and tech like JavaScript, TypScript, SQL and React at my fingers. I learned to include tools like Tailwind, Next.js and Jest to my projects. I am continuing to expand my programming expertise by learning langauges like LaTex, PHP and Flutter/Dart, and by experimenting with tech like Laravel and Docker.
	
	To give you an idea of my work as an engineer, I invite you to play my latest game, Alley Cat, which you can find here: \href{https://cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com/}{cherry-stone-studios.onrender.com}. Allow the game to load for a moment, and then enjoy! I hope it will demonstrate my ability to work with a team to produce a polished product in a short amount of time. The game took my team about 3 weeks to complete, from intital idea to completed project.

	Prior to my latest gaming work, I crafted Apps Scripts over data I gathered in order to automate and integrate the outcomes into other reports. Before that, I was the co-builder for the staff moderation tools, including the original image moderation tools, utilized at ModelMayhem.com. 

	I believe my first-hand knowledge of how the right tool at the right moment can make a world of a difference for a business is why I will make such a great engineer for your team. Thank you for considering my application for the Junior Software Engineer position. I look forward to speaking with you further over how my experience can benefit you!
